# Controlling-Volume-of-the-Computer-Using-Hand-Gestures
This project is inspired by Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI video "Gesture Volume Control | OpenCV Python | Computer Vision" on YouTube. The link for the video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iEPzbG-xLE

This is an OpenCV project in Python that can control the volume of the computer device using Hand Gesutres.

The project demo can be found on my LinkedIn profile. The link for the project demo is:  https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adeeb-fahman-8b49041a5_tried-making-a-beginner-opencv-program-with-activity-6812012501392232448-Hu49?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
